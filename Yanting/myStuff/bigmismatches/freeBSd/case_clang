    Fix the last two CFI callback prototype mismatches
    
    There was the series from me a year ago which fixed most of the
    callback vs implementation prototype mismatches. It was based on
    running the CFI-enabled kernel (in permissive mode -- warning
    instead of panic) and performing a full ZTS cycle, and then fixing
    all of the problems caught by CFI.
    Now, Clang 16-dev has new warning flag, -Wcast-function-type-strict,
    which detect such mismatches at compile-time. It allows to find the
    remaining issues missed by the first series.
    There are only two of them left: one for the
    secpolicy_vnode_setattr() callback and one for taskq_dispatch().
    The fix is easy, since they are not used anywhere else.

    Fixed missing dependencies of genassym.o, gensetdefs.o and vers.o
    on opt_global.h.  This actually matters for genassym.o (it depends
    on at least SMP).
    
    Don't undefine KERNEL for compiling genassym.c.  genassym.o really
    depends on KERNEL, and the prototype mismatches that required
    undefining KERNEL in rev.1.49 no longer exist.
    
    Compile gensetdefs* with the same flags as genassym*.  External
    `gen' programs such linux_genassym should also use these flags
    (${GEN_CFLAGS}).
    
    Fixed missing dependency generation for gensetdefs.o.  C sources
    for external `gen' programs should be added to GEN_CFILES to get
    their dependencies generated.
    
    Cleaned up flags definitions and use.  All of ${CFLAGS} is now
    passed to mkdep and the assembler (both are actually variants of
    ${CC} and will ignore the irrelevant flags).

    Moved db_end_line after db_printf to eliminate forward reference and
    shut up the compiler about prototype mismatch.
