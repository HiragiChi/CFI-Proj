    lib/crypto: blake2s: avoid indirect calls to compression function for Clang CFI
    
    blake2s_compress_generic is weakly aliased by blake2s_compress. The
    current harness for function selection uses a function pointer, which is
    ordinarily inlined and resolved at compile time. But when Clang's CFI is
    enabled, CFI still triggers when making an indirect call via a weak
    symbol. This seems like a bug in Clang's CFI, as though it's bucketing
    weak symbols and strong symbols differently. It also only seems to
    trigger when "full LTO" mode is used, rather than "thin LTO".

    Nonetheless, the function pointer method isn't so terrific anyway, so
    this patch replaces it with a simple boolean, which also gets inlined
    away. This successfully works around the Clang bug.
    
    In general, I'm not too keen on all of the indirection involved here; it
    clearly does more harm than good. Hopefully the whole thing can get
    cleaned up down the road when lib/crypto is overhauled more
    comprehensively. But for now, we go with a simple bandaid.

    tracing/cfi: Fix cmp_entries_* functions signature mismatch
    
    If CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y, attempting to read an event histogram will cause
    the kernel to panic due to failed CFI check.
    
        1. echo 'hist:keys=common_pid' >> events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
        2. cat events/sched/sched_switch/hist
        3. kernel panics on attempting to read hist
    
    This happens because the sort() function expects a generic
    int (*)(const void *, const void *) pointer for the compare function.
    To prevent this CFI failure, change tracing map cmp_entries_* function
    signatures to match this.
    
    Also, fix the build error reported by the kernel test robot [1].

    qemu_fw_cfg: Make fw_cfg_rev_attr a proper kobj_attribute
    
    fw_cfg_showrev() is called by an indirect call in kobj_attr_show(),
    which violates clang's CFI checking because fw_cfg_showrev()'s second
    parameter is 'struct attribute', whereas the ->show() member of 'struct
    kobj_structure' expects the second parameter to be of type 'struct
    kobj_attribute'.

    ACPI: bgrt: Fix CFI violation
    
    clang's Control Flow Integrity requires that every indirect call has a
    valid target, which is based on the type of the function pointer. The
    *_show() functions in this file are written as if they will be called
    from dev_attr_show(); however, they will be called from
    sysfs_kf_seq_show() because the files were created by
    sysfs_create_group() and the sysfs ops are based on kobj_sysfs_ops
    because of kobject_add_and_create(). Because the *_show() functions do
    not match the type of the show() member in struct kobj_attribute, there
    is a CFI violation.

    cfi: add __cficanonical
    
    With CONFIG_CFI_CLANG, the compiler replaces a function address taken
    in C code with the address of a local jump table entry, which passes
    runtime indirect call checks. However, the compiler won't replace
    addresses taken in assembly code, which will result in a CFI failure
    if we later jump to such an address in instrumented C code. The code
    generated for the non-canonical jump table looks this:
    
      <noncanonical.cfi_jt>: /* In C, &noncanonical points here */
            jmp noncanonical
      ...
      <noncanonical>:        /* function body */
            ...
    
    This change adds the __cficanonical attribute, which tells the
    compiler to use a canonical jump table for the function instead. This
    means the compiler will rename the actual function to <function>.cfi
    and points the original symbol to the jump table entry instead:
    
      <canonical>:           /* jump table entry */
            jmp canonical.cfi
      ...
      <canonical.cfi>:       /* function body */
            ...
    
    As a result, the address taken in assembly, or other non-instrumented
    code always points to the jump table and therefore, can be used for
    indirect calls in instrumented code without tripping CFI checks.

    add support for Clang CFI
    
    This change adds support for Clang’s forward-edge Control Flow
    Integrity (CFI) checking. With CONFIG_CFI_CLANG, the compiler
    injects a runtime check before each indirect function call to ensure
    the target is a valid function with the correct static type. This
    restricts possible call targets and makes it more difficult for
    an attacker to exploit bugs that allow the modification of stored
    function pointers. For more details, see:
    
      https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html
    
    Clang requires CONFIG_LTO_CLANG to be enabled with CFI to gain
    visibility to possible call targets. Kernel modules are supported
    with Clang’s cross-DSO CFI mode, which allows checking between
    independently compiled components.
    
    With CFI enabled, the compiler injects a __cfi_check() function into
    the kernel and each module for validating local call targets. For
    cross-module calls that cannot be validated locally, the compiler
    calls the global __cfi_slowpath_diag() function, which determines
    the target module and calls the correct __cfi_check() function. This
    patch includes a slowpath implementation that uses __module_address()
    to resolve call targets, and with CONFIG_CFI_CLANG_SHADOW enabled, a
    shadow map that speeds up module look-ups by ~3x.
    
    Clang implements indirect call checking using jump tables and
    offers two methods of generating them. With canonical jump tables,
    the compiler renames each address-taken function to <function>.cfi
    and points the original symbol to a jump table entry, which passes
    __cfi_check() validation. This isn’t compatible with stand-alone
    assembly code, which the compiler doesn’t instrument, and would
    result in indirect calls to assembly code to fail. Therefore, we
    default to using non-canonical jump tables instead, where the compiler
    generates a local jump table entry <function>.cfi_jt for each
    address-taken function, and replaces all references to the function
    with the address of the jump table entry.
    
    Note that because non-canonical jump table addresses are local
    to each component, they break cross-module function address
    equality. Specifically, the address of a global function will be
    different in each module, as it's replaced with the address of a local
    jump table entry. If this address is passed to a different module,
    it won’t match the address of the same function taken there. This
    may break code that relies on comparing addresses passed from other
    components.
    
    CFI checking can be disabled in a function with the __nocfi attribute.
    Additionally, CFI can be disabled for an entire compilation unit by
    filtering out CC_FLAGS_CFI.
    
    By default, CFI failures result in a kernel panic to stop a potential
    exploit. CONFIG_CFI_PERMISSIVE enables a permissive mode, where the
    kernel prints out a rate-limited warning instead, and allows execution
    to continue. This option is helpful for locating type mismatches, but
    should only be enabled during development.

    remoteproc: core: Remove casting to rproc_handle_resource_t
    
    There are four different callback functions that are used for the
    rproc_handle_resource_t callback that all have different second
    parameter types.
    
    rproc_handle_vdev -> struct fw_rsc_vdev
    rproc_handle_trace -> struct fw_rsc_trace
    rproc_handle_devmem -> struct fw_rsc_devmem
    rproc_handle_carveout -> struct fw_rsc_carveout
    
    These callbacks are cast to rproc_handle_resource_t so that there is no
    error about incompatible pointer types. Unfortunately, this is a Clang's
    Control-Flow Integrity checking violation, which verifies that the
    callback function's types match the prototypes exactly before jumping.

    for these functions.

    CFI validates that all indirect calls go to a function with the same
    exact function pointer prototype. In this case, dwc2_set_bcm_params
    is the target, which has a parameter of type 'struct dwc2_hsotg *',
    but it is being implicitly cast to have a parameter of type 'void *'
    because that is the set_params function pointer prototype. Make the
    function pointer protoype match the definitions so that there is no
    more violation.

    When /sys/firmware/acpi/pm_profile is read, sysfs_kf_seq_show is called,
    which in turn calls kobj_attr_show, which gets the ->show callback
    member by calling container_of on attr (casting it to struct
    kobj_attribute) then calls it.
    
    There is a CFI violation because pm_profile_attr is of type
    struct device_attribute but kobj_attr_show calls ->show expecting it
    to be from struct kobj_attribute. CFI checking ensures that function
    pointer types match when doing indirect calls. Fix pm_profile_attr to
    be defined in terms of kobj_attribute so there is no violation or
    mismatch.

    clk: bcm2835: Remove casting to bcm2835_clk_register
    
    There are four different callback functions that are used for the
    clk_register callback that all have different second parameter types.
    
    bcm2835_register_pll -> struct bcm2835_pll_data
    bcm2835_register_pll_divider -> struct bcm2835_pll_divider_data
    bcm2835_register_clock -> struct bcm2835_clock_data
    bcm2835_register_date -> struct bcm2835_gate_data
    
    These callbacks are cast to bcm2835_clk_register so that there is no
    error about incompatible pointer types. Unfortunately, this is a control
    flow integrity violation, which verifies that the callback function's
    types match the prototypes exactly before jumping.

    To fix this, change the second parameter of all functions void * and use
    a local variable with the correct type so that everything works
    properly. With this, the only use of bcm2835_clk_register is in struct
    bcm2835_clk_desc so we can just remove it and use the type directly.

    hv_netvsc: Fix netvsc_start_xmit's return type
    
    netvsc_start_xmit is used as a callback function for the ndo_start_xmit
    function pointer. ndo_start_xmit's return type is netdev_tx_t but
    netvsc_start_xmit's return type is int.
    
    This causes a failure with Control Flow Integrity (CFI), which requires
    function pointer prototypes and callback function definitions to match
    exactly. When CFI is in enforcing, the kernel panics. When booting a
    CFI kernel with WSL 2, the VM is immediately terminated because of this.
    
    The splat when CONFIG_CFI_PERMISSIVE is used:
